It came home this week, just a few days after I placed the order. Very good packaging in a big cardboard box. My neighbours also got interested in what I had ordered. Was almost assembled. I only had to do 5% of assembly work like the company has mentioned, or maybe even less than that. With my brother‚Äôs help, I could unpack and make the cycle ready to ride in just 15-20 minutes.,The paint finish is vibrant and eye catching. Many people advised me to go for some older brand of bicycle like Hero or BSA or something, but I was not very impressed by those designs.,Another reason I decided to go for LightSpeed was that the bicycle has an aluminium alloy frame and Shimano Tourney Gears, but it is still available at a good cost.,Before buying I saw many reviews of the company on their Facebook and photos of their other customers who have purchased electric cycle from them. so wanted to start with a 21 Gear MTB before spending more money on electric, so I decided to go for the Dryft MTB. In future if I want to make this electric then that is also possible.,My Opinion After Riding:,Apart from very good paint finish and overall good looks, when I started to ride this cycle, it felt amazing. The tyres run very smoothly yet without giving the feeling of slipperiness.,There are Dual Disc brakes so braking is immediate and there is no unnecessary roll over. Dual Disc brakes are also safe for my usage because I have to ride my cycle in crowded areas of the city where traffic is very unruly and bad.,When I rode this cycle on a flyover, and did little bit of riding on rough patches on the sides of the road, there also it was equally easy and comfortable to ride.,The gears are of course great. Never had any doubt of that because they are from Shimano, which is one of the best. Gear shifting is effortless and now I will be experimenting with various gear configurations.,*Highlight for me: Dryft is working very well for my fitness needs. Every now and then I feel like taking it for a spin. Because ergonomics is really good, I can ride long distances comfortably. After trying, my dad is saying he may also start using it to become more active. Because the seat is easy-adjust with quick release tab, one can adjust in seconds for people with different heights.,Cons: As of now nothing, if something comes up I will update here.,My Recommendation: Good investment. I recommend going for this cycle from LightSpeed compared to other brand bicycles. More sporty feel relatively and more value for money.,I bought the Dryft MTB recently after thinking for many months to buy a mountain biking cycle. It was very hot in the recent months so I was waiting for good cycling weather before buying.,I went to some cycle shops in the city also, but then not always getting right guidance or right information, and no new modern designs also available, so I decided to trust the Lightspeed company rating on facebook and Google. Before buying from Amazon I went to the company website and spoke to the owner over whatsapp also.,The company is very helpful and the owner was down to earth. He explained everything to me, answered my questions regarding gears, and helped me choose the right variant.,When the cycle arrived at my house my first thoughts were that I was impressed with packaging quality.,Package also had instructions on how to open. Inside the box there was a proper manual for assembly and usage with tips on what to do what not to do.,Assembly is very minimum because mostly the cycle is assembled 95% like the company says.,Quality of paint is very good. Sometimes when we go to visit some shops also, they don't keep cycles so well and paint is chipped or scratched in many places.,The Dryft paint was flawless.,Now the main thing, the driving experience of this cycle is very good. In my area there are slopes and flyovers. So first I went to test the cycle in such a terrain as it is an MTB.,I have gone for 21 Speed gears version. It worked very well on slopes the effort was managed well by the gears.,Somewhere as an engineer I think the geometry of the cycle frame is also helpful in reducing effort and making the ride more pleasing.,The frame is comparatively light& easy to carry .,Now comes the tyres. This is also good, maybe because the tyre make is of high quality. Kenda tyres are well known to cyclists, so no doubt even on small pebbles and gravel my cycle did not slip or skid.,On a final note, this cycle has dual disk brakes so was very helpful while climbing downhill for me.,Personally, till now no complains. If you are thinking to buy a cycle for 15 or 16 thousand rupees then you can close your eyes and buy this one.",LightSpeed DRYFT MTB ‚Äî Lightweight Aluminium Alloy Frame | Dual Disc Brakes | Hard Tail MTB for Mountain Biking | Superior Grip 2.10 Kenda Tyres
