Have been using it for a few days now and works fine.,Not too heavy, good grip for single and two handed use.,Only downside is the clamps for attaching the sandpaper are not very convenient to use. Require quite a bit of force to hold open with one hand while sliding in the sand paper with the other. If the paper is thick it is a bit difficult to do.,Would have been much better if it had a clip which stays open on its own and can be clamped down once the paper has been put in place.,Very useful, very powerful, handy. No power adjustment ( only one speed). Aesthetically not apealing compared to other Bosch products. Operating switch and lock for continues mode are very close and while holding firmly, the lock gets activated automatically, which I feel bit annoying sometimes, but overall its good. Other concern is noise level which is bit more than rotating orbital sander, but bearable. Its worth having in one's power tool collection.,It is a good quality product and does what it states, however, I found it too slow. It just vibrates a few millimeters and takes a lot of time to get the job done. Manually, I can do the job much faster but then I end up tiring myself. Anyway, I'm sure this product has a purpose.,excellent handy single speed sanding machine. better than circle type. saves money on grit paper,Do the work its made for !!,Nice product by Bosch !!,Fantastic product good sander , will definetly recommend for wood worker,Best Qulty good work finishing thanks Bosch &amozan good product,Used it for around a month.

Looking for switch and other accessories in market otherwise have to return back .,Update on 14:10:2018,After procuring accessories and fixing start switch I used the machine but it stopped working after half an hour of use. However no heating issue was observed during use.,My Verdict- Don't go for it.,Quality is dubious. Bearing went off in 2 days. Had to get it repaired locally.

This was a decided miss, making me wonder if a ""Made in China"" DeWalt would have been better choice.,The box was torn, the tool did NOT have a pleasent smell out of the box (it was stinking). The tool itself was DIRTY and grimy (was it used previously in a slum environment?). The casing screws were loose. The plastic casing moves even when fully tightened.,For a low-powered, entry level tool (home, DIY buyers), not even a cut-off wheel or grinding disc was included.,I should consider looooooonnng and haaaaaarrd before buying another Bosch tool. A few years back ""Bosch"" was a default choice. NOT anymore!,EDIT: Did anyone mention the plug? It LOOKS like an European (German) 2 pin plug, but the pins and the pitch are the wrong dimensions, meaning, it will not fit in a proper German socket. It will, however, fit an Indian socket comfortably... I would never have expected BOSCH of all manufacturers to add to the plug/ socket confusion, but they did.,EDIT 2: In this day and age, the wheel guard is attached to the tool with a FLAT head screw! Really Bosch, haven't you heard of Torx or at least socket head (hex) or Philips head screws? I can never understand Bosch-India's fetish for straight head screws/ bolts.,EDIT 3: After using this grinder several times, I truly regret buying it instead of the Dewalt.,EDIT 4: I opened the gearbox and the bevel gears were BONE DRY.

I have purchased two of these recently. initially (when sparingly used)the grinder did not display any signs of trouble but when the product was actually put to test with long hours of operation both the products failed to operate for more than a few days. I did not worry about it as the item was under warranty. I contacted customer service regarding the issue and was provided a number for local service incharge who further directed me to a local repair shop mentioning it's their authorised repair centre located near goregaon station. The grinder was handed over and after more than 10 days of follow up and blunt excuses the product was allegedly repaired and the owner of the shop demanded payment for the repair job. Once the warranty situation was explained the owner asked for all sorts of warranty documents and bills, once all of these were produced the owner of the shop said the its replaced are not covered under warranty. We paid the owner which was half the grinders cost, money was not an issue here but the dubious nature of service made us feel cheated. Both machines stopped working within the next two days. we have bought two grinders for local trusted dealer and seems to be working fine till date and is waranteed under repair and part replacement for a year. Lost faith in Black and Decker brand name. Would advice to stay away from the product and suggest buying machine tools from trustes local seller, the cheap price is not worth the trouble.,It worked well in the beginning, got wrecked within a week.

I cannot and could not hesitate to give 5 out of 5 points only on the easy handling and smoothness in working environment. It has a very good saw dust even the smallest particles suction inbuilt capacity so much so that you feel very much comfortable yourself enough to work with this machine the whole day.
